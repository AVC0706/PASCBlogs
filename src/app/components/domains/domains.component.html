                  For the overall development of our members, we have created
                  several SIGs namely, Machine learning, Web Development,
                  Android Development, Competitive Coding, Electronics and Cyber
                  Security.New domains are to be added such as Blockchain and
                  Cloud Computing. Regular meetups and teaching sessions are
                  conducted by PASC members so that like-minded people can come
                  together, interact and share knowledge with each other.
                  <span class="d-none d-md-inline">
                    We nurture the growth of inquisitive minds by providing them
                    with every opportunity to excel in various fields. The
                    chapter organizes seminars and workshops on different
                    domains by speakers who are well-known in their fields,
                    which give students opportunities to learn about advanced
                    research subjects.
